# 🤖 5-DOF Robotic Arm

A project focused on designing and controlling a 5-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator using Arduino-based PWM actuation and a custom serial communication protocol.

---

## 🔹 System Overview

The manipulator consists of:

- Base (Yaw)
- Shoulder
- Elbow
- Wrist Pitch
- Differential Dual-Servo Gripper

The system enables precise joint-level positioning through serial command parsing and deterministic PWM signal generation.
